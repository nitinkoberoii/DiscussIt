# DiscussIt

DiscussIt is a responsive reddit clone built on my journey to learn full stack App-Development using Flutter and Firebase.

This app contains most of the popular features of reddit such as creating & editing communities, posting on communities, etc. The user can login via google as well as via email and password. The user can add moderators of the community, the moderators can edit the community profiles, etc. User can add different types of posts containing either link, text or image. The post has a feature of upvoting, downvoting and commenting. The app also has the feature of toggling themes.
